class CharVectorizer(object):
    """A class to convert lists of strings into concatenated one hot vectors
    (one one-hot-vector per char).

    == Example, Introduction ==

    Example usage for two string windows:
        vectorizer = CharVectorizer("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
        windows = [
            "the fox jumped over the fence.",
            "another fox did something. And"
        ]
        target_length = max(len(window) for window in windows)
        matrix = vectorizer.transform(windows, target_length)

    The resulting matrix is a numpy matrix.
    You may feed it e.g. into a neural network.
    Each row of the matrix is a long concatenated vector made up of
    one hot vectors of each char. See more for that in transform().


    == accepted_chars and map_unknown_chars_to ==

    The class expects the chars to project onto one hot vectors (given
    in accepted_chars) and another char (map_unknown_chars_to)
    which will be used as a mapping for chars that are not contained
    in accepted_chars. Notice that map_unknown_chars_to itself may be
    contained in accepted_chars. E.g. you may set
        accepted_chars = "ABCX"
    and
        map_unknown_chars_to = "X".
    Then there will be one hot vectors for A, B, C and X. Any other
    char will get the one hot vector of X. (Therefore, X will be
    ambiguous.) You do not have to add map_unknown_chars_to to
    accepted_chars, it will be added automatically if neccessary.


    == target length, fill_left_char, fill_right_char ==

    Notice that in the example above, the target_length gets calculated
    dynamically. In most cases however, you would know your intended
    window length (e.g. 50 chars) and should use that number.
    You can safely provide windows that are longer or shorter than
    that window length, they will automatically be increased/decreased
    in size.
    If one of the strings must be increased in length that will either
    happen by adding chars on the left of that string (at its start)
    or by appending chars at the right of that string (at its end).
    Which of option will be chosen is defined by the parameter
    fill_right in transform(). If chars are appended on the right, then
    fill_right_char will be used for that, otherwise fill_left_char.


    == auto_lowercase and auto_uppercase ==

    This vectorizer can automatically project chars onto their lowercase
    or uppercase variants, when neccessary. E.g. set auto_lowercase to
    True in order to automatically lowercase chars. Notice that lowercase
    will only be used, if the uppercase variant isn't contained in
    accepted_chars (or in map_unknown_chars_to, fill_left_char and
    fill_right_char). The lowercase letter must also be in one of the
    mentioned parameters.


    == Reversing transformations ==

    You can reverse the transformation by using reverse_transform(matrix),
    e.g.
        ...
        matrix = vectorizer.transform(windows, target_length)
        strings = vectorizer.reverse_transform(matrix)
    If you have a kinda fuzzy matrix (e.g. the result of a neural network
    output) then you may use reverse_transform_maxval() instead. It choses
    the maximum value per one hot vector as 1 and all others as 0.

    Attributes:
        auto_lowercase: Whether to automatically map uppercase chars to
            lowercase ones if neccessary and possible.
        auto_uppercase: Whether to automatically map lowecase chars to
            uppercase ones if neccessary and possible.
        map_unknown_chars_to: A char onto which all chars will be mapped
            that are not explicitly contained in accepted_chars.
        fill_left_char: A character to use, when filling up too short
            strings on the left. Will be added internally to accepted_chars
            automatically.
        fill_right_char: A character to use, when filling up too short
            strings on the right. Will be added internally to accepted_chars
            automatically.
        accepted_chars: A list of chars that are accepted by this vectorizer.
            That means that they will be mapped to one hot vectors instead
            of using the one hot vector of the char map_unknown_chars_to.
            Notice that this is not identical to the parameter accepted_chars
            in the constructor, as this list contains also the chars
            map_unknown_chars_to, fill_left_char and fill_right_char.
        accepted_chars_indirect: The same list as accepted_chars, extended
            by lowercase and uppercase variants of chars (if auto_lowercase
            and/or auto_uppercase is set to True).
        char_to_index: A dictionary mapping each char to a unique index.
            That index is rougly the same as the position in accepted_chars.
            (With some additional chars in the case of
            auto_lowercase/auto_uppercase.)
        unknown_chars_regex: A regex that matches all chars that are not
            contained in accepted_chars_indirect."""

        lengths (per_string_length) and optionally whether too short strings
        should be filled up on the right (at their end) or on the left (at
        their start).
        The method will convert every single char into a one hot vector,
        e.g. "a" might be turned into [1, 0, 0], "b" into [0, 1, 0] and
        "c" into [0, 0, 0]. The method will then concatenate for each of the
        strings all of their one hot vectors to one big vector,
        e.g. "abc" might be turned into [1,0,0, 0,1,0, 0,0,0]. This is done
        for every string, so the result will be one big matrix, where each
        row resembles a string and the columns are made up by one hot
        vectors.

        Every row in the matrix must have the same length, therefore that
        length must be provided by per_string_length.
        Strings that are too short for that length will automatically be

        self.fill_left_char will instead be added to the start/left of
